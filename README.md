# e-Lock Fractal — Dimension Locks to e ≈ 2.718

A self-similar fractal where the similarity dimension naturally converges to the base of the natural logarithm **e ≈ 2.71828** through exponential scaling and self-resonance.

## Key Idea
- Scale factor per level: s = 1/e ≈ 0.367879
- Effective branching tuned for resonance → dimension D = e in the continuous limit
- Emerges as attractor when maximizing continuous compounding efficiency

## Convergence Simulation
Simple Python script showing iterative convergence to e from different starting points.

(We'll add the code file next)
